# OSGC

Undergraduate STEM Scholarship from the Ohio Aerospace Institute to conduct my own self led research that aligns with the NASA mission directorates; in the case of this project, the directorate was Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate Advanced Air Vehicles and more specifically research in Airspace Operations and Safety.

# Project Description

Through my job as a student research assistant, I was approached with an opportunity to conduct my own self-led research. Commercial airports require routine recertification to ensure the safety of planes and passengers. To aid in this process, software will be developed to acquire real Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). These DEMs will be integrated into two flight modeling softwares: the Ohio University Glideslope Model (OUGS), which is used to predict the performance of glide slope (GS) systems within a non-uniform terrain environment, and the Ohio University NAVAID Performance Prediction Model (OUNPPM), which can simulate three types of systems: localizer, glide slope, and VHF omnidirectional ranging system (VOR). This integration aims to improve the modeling software's precision to improve flight operation safety. This project has three main components: the Python web-scraper to collect the DEMs, a Flask API running in a Docker container to accurately send the elevation data requested by the user using latitude and longitude coordinates, and the integration of the API requests and the new input fields for the user's coordinates into the OUNPPM and OUGS projects.
